# Data-Structures
In a variation of the Candy Crush Saga game (the platform was provided by our professor), the aim of this project was to create a player, whose next move is based on Minimax algorithm, in order to compete the classmates’ players. A tree of depth 2 was generated and a heuristic evaluation function was used to assign a value to each player’s possible move (leaf nodes) according to subjective criteria. The number of candies collected within a limited amount of time determined the winner.
